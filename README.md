This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL to extract valuable business insights. The dataset consists of four key tables—Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, and Pizza Types—capturing essential information about sales transactions, product details, and customer preferences. 
Using SQL queries, various analyses were conducted to identify top-selling pizzas, peak sales hours, and revenue trends. The data was explored for inconsistencies, and queries were designed to extract key metrics such as total sales, category-wise performance, and order frequency.
By leveraging JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions, deeper insights were obtained regarding customer preferences and business performance. The results provide actionable recommendations for optimizing inventory, pricing, and promotional strategies.
Additionally, a database schema was created to visualize table relationships. Future enhancements could include integrating Power BI or Tableau for advanced visualizations, applying predictive analytics to forecast demand, and implementing customer segmentation for personalized marketing strategies. 
This project demonstrates how structured data analysis can support data-driven decision-making in the food and beverage industry.
